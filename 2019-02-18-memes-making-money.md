Memes are no more just funny content that you watch and giggle about.

It ofcourse is that but additionally it has big sums of money involved in with it, big companies like apple have profitted from it for
example, recently launched air pods from apple were a part of meme which led to a high demand of airpods leading it to being sold out
from the apple website.

Memes have been a big part of our enhanced interest into instagram and facebook, these social media platforms would have been boring
without meme's and all the cat videos, this gives these platforms a major boost to audience retention and times being spent on these apps.
This generates advertisement revenue for facebook.

Memes are everywhere they can be used in promotion strategy campaings for products and brands to even spreading a message. Netflix on thier
India instagram portal posts memes about its own shows and actors involved which creates a good community engagement within the users of 
netflix. Netflix is killing on their meme strategy out there and other cool brands should adopt it too.

To know more about meme's and their money making strategies listen to the Episode 99 of PODCAST - Make Me Smart. The name of the episode is-
'When memes are money makers'.
